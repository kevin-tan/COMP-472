Ensure scitkit-learn, numpy and matplotlib packages are installed.
If using a different dataset ensure to add the data file under /data

1) Replace the default file_path_name on line 17 with the dataset you wish to use to train + test (ensure its in /data)
2) run 'python AssignmentOne.py'
3) Wait for about 10-30 mins (will take time to perform GridSearchCV)

Note that the models are being trained with the dataset found in file_path_name.
